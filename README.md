# Recursive Graphing Calculator

This project is a JavaScript graphical calculator based in [GraphR](https://github.com/yerich/Graphr)  that displays recursive functions within themselves. It is similar in style to Desmos or Geogebra, but with the added feature of recursively graphing functions.

## How It Works

The Recursive Graphing Calculator allows the user to enter a function of x and see the graph of that function. It then applies that same function to itself, creating a new graph within the original graph. This process can be repeated indefinitely, creating a fractal-like image.

## Installation or visualization

To use the Recursive Graphing Calculator, simply download the project files and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
It is also possible to follow the pinned [link](irbel69.github.io/recursive-fx-calculator/) on the github project description.

## Usage

Enter a function of x into the input field at the top of the page and click "Execute" to see the graph of that function. To apply the function recursively, click the recursive "f(f(x))" button. Each subsequent click of the this button will apply the function to the previous graph, creating a new graph within it.

By pressing the "config" button, a new menu will be unfolded in which it is possible to aspects such as the radians degrees and gradients configuration or the resolution in which the equations are shown.

## Examples

Here are some example functions that can be graphed using the Recursive Graphing Calculator:

It is also possible to hide functions by pressing the couloured circle behind each equation text input.
